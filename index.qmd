In 2024 the results of [elections of Russian president](https://www.politico.eu/article/charles-michel-congratulate-vladimir-putin-landslide-win-voting-russia-election/ "EU president congratulates Putin on ‘landslide’ win, Politico") was reported as high as [87%](https://www.politico.eu/article/putin-wins-rigged-russian-election-with-88-of-the-vote-exit-poll/ "Putin ‘wins’ rigged Russian election with 87 percent of the vote, Politico"). Although abroad Russians are not punished for calling the war how it shell be named and a lot of people from Russia flee[^1]^,^[^2] away from prosecution, arrests and repression machine[^3]^,^[^4] the result from abroad are - 72%, still. Not only in Russia election procedure turns into [acclamation](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/03/26/unpresidented-en "Unpresidented, Novaya Gazeta Europe") but the state meticulously control the results of Russians voting abroad to get an impressive result from 1.7% of total election voices.

While we look at historical data one can see that from 45 till 30% are military or "controlled" votes. How these calculated? All military located pooling stations are included in this label. So without that the genuine result is about 33%. Also, in the last 2024 year there is a clear signs of fake ballots at least injected in Cyprus. Why so?

You might have seen [long ques](https://youtu.be/BFU9X36KlDw?si=4zSgTG6geqxUilW7 "At Russian Embassies Across Europe Large Crowds Gather To Vote, CNN") in Europe of people who wanted to vote on this elections. In case we look at turnout results a few locations stand out, among them Cyprus with 903% increase in total voters. Among those increase - 36,838 people reportedly have been voting from home at one polling station, while last time in 2018 for the whole country it was only 5,278. Bangladesh (482 to 4058), Egypt (1518 to 4765) with the tremendous increase in votes and Turkey where exit poll observes have been kicked out from the street nearby station are under suspicion as well.

Though only Cyprus with support of all military presence is enough. Looking at the cumulative number of voters indicates that only top four countries, including unrecognized states Abkhazia, Osetia and Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic gives about 42% of all Russian citizens abroad. Simple recipe is to make sure there you get 94% or more there and your final results are almost known.

@fig-how_voted_gif demonstrates dynamic of voting for Russian president from abroad. In 2004 it was almost first elections from abroad and the result was 84%, in 2008 new name appeared on ballots and it go 86%. In 2012 quite a lot of people were not that happy with come back of Putin, you can see it by increase of spread over y axis, some countries results were way below 50%, though in total it's 73%. However in 2018 again all points are moving upwards and there is no single country with result \< 50%, 85% overall. In 2020 the turnout was twice less than in 2018. Finally in 2024 the spread between the countries is clearly increases, overall result is 72%.

[![Amount of people per country (X) vs results for Putin (Y)](out/elec_04_24_country.gif){#fig-how_voted_gif fig-align="center" width="600"}](fig-how_voted_gif)

In 2012 a lot of people who voted against Putin came to polling stations in comparison to 2008 (+71,912, blue dots below), those numbers were higher than complimentary voters who also increase. In 2018 the critically thinking electorate didn't came (- 48,566) and thus increase of pro-government voters (+76,675) gave that consolidate result in 2018. In 2024 in almost all regions, except Asia, protest voters decided to come and vote against Putin in [response to Navalny's call](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/03/17/russia-presidential-election-putin-protest/ "Russian voters, answering Navalny’s call, protest as Putin extends his rule, Washington Post"), while supporters remain passive.

However even abroad the state controls the outcome not by fair elections but manipulating with ballots and make sure that military controlled territories express their voices enough, up to 96%. As said this is acclamation, not election.
